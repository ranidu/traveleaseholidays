                                        <p>Sri Lanka is a lush, tropical island paradise, known to Arab traders as Serendib - hence the word "serendipity", meaning discovery by happy accident. It was famously described by Marco Polo as "undoubtedly the finest
                                            island of its size in the world".</p>
                                        <p>This is a culturally rich and environmentally diverse country, with nine World Heritage Sites (the oldest dating back to the 3rd Century BC); 86 species of mammals (including elephant and leopard) and more than
                                            400 bird species (including 26 endemics); a colorful array of flowering plants and trees, and a Hill Country famous for tea; 14 National Parks out of 100 areas protected by the government; and an Indian Ocean
                                            coastline boasting palm-fringed and sandy tropical beaches.</p>
                                        <p>Sri Lanka, once known as Serendib Taprobane is now also known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. This paradise isle, which is indeed shaped like a pearl, offers pristine beaches, lush tea estates, and more waterfalls
                                            perhaps than any other country- a staggering 350 that cascade dramatically down rolling, Hillsides and mist-shrouded mountains, and a culture that reaches back over 2,500 years. Famous for its spices and spice
                                            plantations, Sri Lanka was described by a renowned botanist, as simply one big botanical garden.</p>

                                <li>On Arrival at the Airport, you will first reach Immigration, then to collect your ‘checked-in’ baggage. Once you clear customs, our representative will page you and meet you just outside the arrival hall. </li>

                                    Shorts and t-shirts are allowed in most settings, except when visiting temples and other religious establishments. Ladies are required to cover the shoulders as well, when visiting places of worship.</li>
                                <li>Temperatures throughout the year in lowland areas (sea level to 1500 feet amsl) range from an average of 25 degrees Celsius at night to 32 degrees Celsius during the day (the real feel temperature is almost always higher).
                                    In the hill country (above 1500 feet amsl) the average temperatures range from an average of 15 degrees Celsius at night to 22 degrees Celsius during the day. Please note that if you are travelling during winter, to
                                    the hill country, it is advisable to wear a light to medium jersey, as temperatures do on occasion dip to single figures. </li>

                                <li>Tipping is customary, but not obligatory. But if you are keen to know what is acceptable in local terms, it ranges between US$5/- per day up to US$25/- per day depending on the level of satisfaction of your driver when
                                    it comes to individual / family travel. For group travel other than the guide, the coach crew is to be tipped too. The amount for a day can vary depending on group size, but the recommended amount is US$15/- to US$40/-
