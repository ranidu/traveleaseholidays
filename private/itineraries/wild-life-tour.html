                                            Arab traders as Serendib - hence the word "serendipity", meaning discovery
                                            by happy accident. It was famously described by Marco Polo as "undoubtedly
                                            the finest island of its size in the world".</p>

                                            Century BC); 86 species of mammals (including elephant and leopard) and more
                                            than 400 bird species (including 26 endemics); a colorful array of flowering
                                            plants and trees, and a Hill Country famous for tea; 14 National Parks out
                                            of 100 areas protected by the government; and an Indian Ocean coastline
                                            boasting palm-fringed and sandy tropical beaches.</p>
                                        <p>Sri Lanka, once known as Serendib Taprobane is now also
                                            known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. This paradise isle, which is indeed
                                            shaped like a pearl, offers pristine beaches, lush tea estates, and more
                                            waterfalls perhaps than any other country- a staggering 350 that cascade
                                            dramatically down rolling, Hillsides and mist-shrouded mountains, and a
                                            culture that reaches back over 2,500 years. Famous for its spices and spice
                                            plantations, Sri Lanka was described by a renowned botanist, as simply one
                                            big botanical garden.</p>

                                                <p>After breakfast, depart for Wilpattu National Park – the largest nature reserve in Sri Lanka. This awe-inspiring nature reserve is unlike any other, with its many wetland marshes and lakes (villu). </p>
                                                <p>The nature reserve consists of scrubland, open grassy plains, rocky outcrops, a coastal belt and dense forest. All this result in an expansive range of fauna and flora. You will witness Asian Elephants, Bears, Leopards, Water Buffaloes, Deer, Mugger Crocodiles and a host of other mammals, reptiles and amphibians. Hundreds of species of birds, ranging from the Sri Lankan Jungle Fowl to Gulls to Painted Storks, are found within the confines of the park, many who migrate during the winter months. Visitors are able to access 25% of the park itself, due to the rest being dense forest. An amazing sight to behold are the herds of Elephants and Water Buffaloes that congregate at the many lakes, putting on a display of unparalleled communal harmony not found anywhere else in the animal kingdom. </p>
                                                <p>Upon completion of the tour of Wilpattu National Park, depart back to Anuradhapura. Upon arriving, you will enjoy a city tour of this sprawling and majestic city, filled with monuments, temples, monastic complexes, palaces, ruins and courtyards, which are well-preserved and spellbinding. </p>
                                                <p>Visit the ruins of one of Sri Lanka’s oldest capitals and one of the oldest continuous inhabited cities in the world, founded in the 05th century BC. Here is found the largest number of ancient monuments of a great civilization. Buddhism found its first real home in Sri Lanka at Anuradhapura, and it thus contains some of Theravada Buddhism’s most sacred sites. </p>
                                                <p>Thereafter, visit the “Sri Maha Bodhi” Bo Tree, which is the oldest authentically verified tree in the world, with a history spanning over 2,000 years. The “Sri Maha Bodhi” tree in Anuradhapura, planted from a cutting from the original “Bo Tree” under which the Buddha received enlightenment, continues to draw thousands of Buddhist pilgrims from around the world. The pillars of the brazen palace which once had nine stories, the image of the Samadhi Buddha which is one of the finest pieces of Buddhists sculpture, the twin ponds, guard-stones and the moon-stones are amazing remains and reminders of a great civilisation. </p>

This nature reserve is located in the so called “Elephant Corridor”, which joins 2 other parks (Kaudulla and Wasgomuwa), hence, this is the ideal place to observe large herds of Asian Elephants, throughout the year. It is known as the largest gathering of Asian Elephants in the world, and is sure to take your breath away, as you observe these pachyderms engage in grazing around and bathing in the Minneriya reservoir. In addition to Elephants, you can also observe Leopards, Bears, Water Buffaloes, and Wild Boar etc. As in many lowland parks on the island, vegetation consists of tropical evergreen forests, to grassy plains and scrubland. There are wetlands and marshes in close proximity to the reservoir, an area filled with various storks and gulls. </p>

                                <li>Sri Lanka being a tropical county, is hot and humid. Ideal clothing would be cotton
                                    and comfortable clothing, casual footwear or slippers and a wide brim hat. Please
                                    use suntan lotion, because the UV index is always high. Shorts and t-shirts are
                                    allowed in most settings, except when visiting temples and other religious
                                    establishments. Ladies are required to cover the shoulders as well, when visiting

                                    the day (the real feel temperature is almost always higher). In the hill country
                                    (above 1500 feet amsl) the average temperatures range from an average of 15 degrees
                                    Celsius at night to 22 degrees Celsius during the day. Please note that if you are
                                    travelling during winter, to the hill country, it is advisable to wear a light to
                                    medium jersey, as temperatures do on occasion dip to single figures. </li>

                                <li>Tipping is customary, but not obligatory. But if you are keen to know what is
                                    acceptable in local terms, it ranges between US$5/- per day up to US$25/- per day
                                    depending on the level of satisfaction of your driver when it comes to individual /
                                    family travel. For group travel other than the guide, the coach crew is to be tipped
                                    too. The amount for a day can vary depending on group size, but the recommended
                                    amount is US$15/- to US$40/- per day.</li>
