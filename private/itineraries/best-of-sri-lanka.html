                                        <p>Sri Lanka is a lush, tropical island paradise, known to Arab traders as Serendib - hence the word "serendipity", meaning discovery by happy accident. It was famously described by Marco Polo as "undoubtedly the finest
                                            island of its size in the world".</p>
                                        <p>This is a culturally rich and environmentally diverse country, with nine World Heritage Sites (the oldest dating back to the 3rd Century BC); 86 species of mammals (including elephant and leopard) and more than
                                            400 bird species (including 26 endemics); a colorful array of flowering plants and trees, and a Hill Country famous for tea; 14 National Parks out of 100 areas protected by the government; and an Indian Ocean
                                            coastline boasting palm-fringed and sandy tropical beaches.</p>
                                        <p>Sri Lanka, once known as Serendib Taprobane is now also known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. This paradise isle, which is indeed shaped like a pearl, offers pristine beaches, lush tea estates, and more waterfalls
                                            perhaps than any other country- a staggering 350 that cascade dramatically down rolling, Hillsides and mist-shrouded mountains, and a culture that reaches back over 2,500 years. Famous for its spices and spice
                                            plantations, Sri Lanka was described by a renowned botanist, as simply one big botanical garden.</p>

                                    the hill country, it is advisable to wear a light to medium jersey, as temperatures do on occasion dip to single figures. </li>

                                <li>Tipping is customary, but not obligatory. But if you are keen to know what is acceptable in local terms, it ranges between US$5/- per day up to US$25/- per day depending on the level of satisfaction of your driver when
                                    it comes to individual / family travel. For group travel other than the guide, the coach crew is to be tipped too. The amount for a day can vary depending on group size, but the recommended amount is US$15/- to US$40/-
