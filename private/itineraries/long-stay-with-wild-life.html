                                            Arab traders as Serendib - hence the word "serendipity", meaning discovery
                                            by happy accident. It was famously described by Marco Polo as "undoubtedly
                                            the finest island of its size in the world".</p>

                                            Century BC); 86 species of mammals (including elephant and leopard) and more
                                            than 400 bird species (including 26 endemics); a colorful array of flowering
                                            plants and trees, and a Hill Country famous for tea; 14 National Parks out
                                            of 100 areas protected by the government; and an Indian Ocean coastline
                                            boasting palm-fringed and sandy tropical beaches.</p>
                                        <p>Sri Lanka, once known as Serendib Taprobane is now also
                                            known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. This paradise isle, which is indeed
                                            shaped like a pearl, offers pristine beaches, lush tea estates, and more
                                            waterfalls perhaps than any other country- a staggering 350 that cascade
                                            dramatically down rolling, Hillsides and mist-shrouded mountains, and a
                                            culture that reaches back over 2,500 years. Famous for its spices and spice
                                            plantations, Sri Lanka was described by a renowned botanist, as simply one
                                            big botanical garden.</p>

                                    meet you just outside the arrival hall. </li>
                                <li>Sri Lanka being a tropical county, is hot and humid. Ideal clothing would be cotton
                                    and comfortable clothing, casual footwear or slippers and a wide brim hat. Please
                                    use suntan lotion, because the UV index is always high. Shorts and t-shirts are
                                    allowed in most settings, except when visiting temples and other religious
                                    establishments. Ladies are required to cover the shoulders as well, when visiting

                                    range from an average of 25 degrees Celsius at night to 32 degrees Celsius during
                                    the day (the real feel temperature is almost always higher). In the hill country
                                    (above 1500 feet amsl) the average temperatures range from an average of 15 degrees
                                    Celsius at night to 22 degrees Celsius during the day. Please note that if you are
                                    travelling during winter, to the hill country, it is advisable to wear a light to
                                    medium jersey, as temperatures do on occasion dip to single figures. </li>

                                    acceptable in local terms, it ranges between US$5/- per day up to US$25/- per day
                                    depending on the level of satisfaction of your driver when it comes to individual /
                                    family travel. For group travel other than the guide, the coach crew is to be tipped
                                    too. The amount for a day can vary depending on group size, but the recommended
